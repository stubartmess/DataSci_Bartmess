# DataSci

Hello all, 

I've been working with data for some time now, doing a combination of data analytics consulting and software development for the supply chain startup SupplyVue, and have had a lot of opportunities to work with databases, solve assorted business challenges, design and craft some neat modeling and simulation tools, take the lead at times in establishing better devops processes, and get intimately involved with maintaining, developing, and deploying software in a production environment. This has been a fantastic learning experience with some of the kindest and cleverest people, and I've been given a lot of responsibility and autonomy. 

There have been a few times where I stumbled across a neat problem, but I had to resist the urge to crack it because there was no business case, and my efforts would be better spent elsewhere. Some of these problems have been niggling at my mind, and I'd like to use this space to flesh out some solutions on my own time. I'm sure most of these have been solved by someone already, so I don't want to google too much; I'd rather see if I can get a good answer on my own. 

I've been wanting to dive deeper into data science for some time now, so in the process I'll try out a few new technologies I haven't gotten around to yet. 

Later on I'd also like to compete in some Kaggle competitions, and probably use this space for that as well. 
 
Let's see where I can take this! 
 
Tschau y'all, 

Stu
